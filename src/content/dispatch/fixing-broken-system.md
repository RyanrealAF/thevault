I want to ask everyone this one simple question and that is Do we have to lock up everyone like they're fucking dogs Like they're a rabid dog that's gonna bite people? Take for example somebody who's addicted to drugs And they're stealing things to support their habit. Do they, as a consequence? Pretend they're a toddler. Okay, what would you do? Do you think when you're disciplining a toddler or a child, for them, your consequence is based on the seriousness of the offense, right? And so, does a person that is a person that's stealing just for the drug habit, is that someone that needs to be locked away like a rabid dog who's gonna bite people? Like a rabid dog who's gonna bite people, I think no.

And California is doing a great job at reforming their correctional system and getting away from warehousing people. That's not productive, right? The productive... what you, the hope is that people who are doing bad things stop doing bad things, right? Our housing them doesn't help that because really when you do time, when you're in the middle, when you're actually doing the time, it's really irrelevant because it passes by. And then before you know, you're out and it seems like nothing. So what did what did somebody learn while they were locked up, right? That's the key. Like doing treatment while they're locked up. That's what's important. Fixing whatever the fuck is broken inside them that causes them to do that stuff.

I took a victim empathy class when I was in prison and it changed my life. It completely changed my life. You can think whatever you want to think about me. But when I took that class and I left there and I went back to my bunk and I meditated on what I just heard, it fundamentally changed me. It made me have remorse for the first time in my life. It made me have empathy for the people that I'd hurt and it crippled me. Even after getting released, I remember sitting at a job and sitting there and I would just break down because All the guilt and remorse and empathy that I felt in that moment, it was like a tidal wave that crashed over me. And it was intense. And it was beautiful because it was real. And it was raw. And it was something that I had never experienced before. And it was something that I needed to experience. And it was something that I needed to feel. And it was something that I needed to understand. And it was something that I needed to carry with me for the rest of my life.
